Running the file Run_me_NCPD.m allows you to run the experiment on a synthetic data set for the three-way NCPD problem (namely, the input tensor [100,100,100] and r=20), see the supplementary material of the paper 
"Inertial Block Proximal Methods for Non-Convex Non-Smooth Optimization", Le Thi Khanh Hien, Nicolas Gillis and Panos Patrinos, ICML 2020. 

It compares with three state-of-the-art NCPD methods, namely,
